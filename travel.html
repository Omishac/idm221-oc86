            <h3>Week 1: Jun 24th - Jul 1st 2022</h3> 
            <p>Week 1 of my Travels consisted of many flights. I started on the 24th from PHL airport, flew to Doha Qatar, and had a layover for 4 hours, and then headed to Mumbai, India for 48 hours to visit my aunt and uncle then took a flight to Kolkata, India for 5 days to my parent's hometowns and then head back to Mumbai for 3 to 4 days. In my time in Kolkata, I went to visit my big extended family after not seeing them for 6 years. I also got my nose pierced the day before I go back to Mumbai. Four hours before I go for my flight I had to go to the ER at 3 am because my nose ring sunk into my nose. After that situation got situation, I went on my flight to Mumbai with my cousin. That was the end of my week 1:) </p>

            <h3>Week 2: Jul 1st - Jul 8th 2022</h3> 
            <p>Week two mostly consisted of seeing touristy things in Punjab and just seeing the overall culture. I got to see the India and Pakistan border. The environment at this border felt as if I was sitting at a Super Bowl game and the teams that were playing were the biggest rivals. I also got to go explore more street markets and eat a lot of fruit on the side of the street which was my favorite part because the fruit was so fresh and refreshing, especially during the humid heat. That concludes what happened in my week 2.</p>

            <h3>Week 3: Jul 8th - Jul 15th 2022</h3> 
            <p>Week 3 my family came to India to meet up with me; we met in Punjab, India. During this time we went to the Golden Temple which is something very famous sacred temple. In this time I got to try a Mcdonald's that's fully vegetarian food. In my opinion, it was better and more flavorful that the one we have here. This place was very modern while still having the historical monuments that they have preserved. The food was full of Thali's which is a giant plate with small bowls filled with mini servings of each dish. After spending a week there we flew back to Punjab, India to fly back to Kolkata, India. That was the end of week 3.</p>

            <h3>Week 4: Jul 15th - Jul 24th 2022</h3> 
            <p>Week 4 I stayed on a mountain called Mussoorie; it was near the Himalayas. During this time it was very cool to see the different cultures from life in the mountain. Life in the mountain is very different from life down here, and the air is very fresh. The food consists of momos and maggie which is kinda like ramen. There were also a lot of stray dogs and street markets to visit that were filled with a lot of handcrafted goods. After spending a week there we flew back to Punjab, India to fly back home to the states. That was the end of my week 4, and my vacation in India :) </p>
